## Welcome to Retta Pages

Retta is an API platform based on the binance smart chain, which enables developers to quickly create highly efficient decentralized applications with a flexible development framework. The provision of Http service IPFS in the web3 bridging protocol can greatly improve the performance of large-scale Dapps, and the pure microservice architecture improves the process efficiency and reliability of Dapps.

Retta is committed to the development of decentralized applications on the Binance chain, and runs on a self-developed binance smart chain. The DAPP Retta will be put into practice as soon as possible, so as to help realize a prosperous blockchain platform for enterprise users. The DAPP Retta will provide free and unlimited storage space for enterprise users, based on the decentralized file system InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol. It will also realize the storage and transmission of encrypted data in the blockchain. Therefore, it can provide a better user experience through the elimination of existing bottlenecks such as "data portability" and "data integrity" in centralized servers. Users can simply drag-and-drop files into a box and click download button to obtain the original file information of their own data.
